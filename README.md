[ShareChess](https://sharechess.github.io/) is a free, open-source website that allows you to:

- share chess games as self-contained replay links (the whole game is stored in the URL),
- create images and animations of chess games and positions,
- install additional chessboard styles and piece sets for major chess websites!
